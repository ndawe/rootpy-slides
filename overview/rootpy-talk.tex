    ``I am a PhD student in High Energy Physics at Simon Fraser
    University searching for the Higgs boson as a member of the ATLAS
    collaboration at CERN. I use Python and rootpy for the processing and
    analysis of terabytes of data on the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid and our
    institute's local cluster.''\\

    \frametitle{Why Python and rootpy?}
    \begin{block}{Status quo}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Write large portions of analysis code in CINT macros.
            \item Very restricted to what ROOT provides and ROOT-based
                collaboration software.
            \item Often spend more time debugging your code (or someone else's
                code\ldots) than performing data analysis.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{A better world}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Use an actual scripting language for high-level analysis:
                Python.
            \item Avoid common pitfalls when working with a low-level
                programming language: increased productivity.
            \item Increased portability of the data formats into other forms
            \item Use large feature-rich and fast libraries for computationally
                intensive tasks: NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, astropy,
                PyTables, matplotlib\ldots
            \item Perform complicated analysis more efficiently while writing
                less code. Resulting code is often more readable by others
                too\ldots
        \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{rootpy: design \& philosophy}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item rootpy does not aim to reproduce ROOT in Python
        but rather provide a layer on top of PyROOT that integrates more
        naturally with Python:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Setting and getting parameters with simple attributes:\\
                {\bf hist.linecolor = `red'}
            \item Simple navigation through TFiles:\\
                {\bf hist = myfile.somedirectory.otherdirectory.histname}
            \item Support for Python exceptions and logging
            \item Python has a garbage collector but C++ does not: leads to
                strange issues in PyROOT. rootpy addresses these problems.
            \item Arithmetic operators that are otherwise not implemented in
                PyROOT are implemented in rootpy
        \end{itemize}
        \item rootpy classes simply inherit from the corresponding ROOT classes
            and may override methods to add functionality or be decorated with
            additional attributes
        \item rootpy classes typically have the same name as ROOT classes with
            the T removed
            but instead of having many histogram classes rootpy has three: Hist,
            Hist2D, Hist3D with a type argument in the constructor that controls
            which ROOT.THX is inherited from.
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Summary and Outlook}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Python is a very powerful language for high-level analysis
        \item rootpy provides a more pythonic way of using ROOT in Python and
            the freedom to interface with a large and growing collection of very
            powerful scientific python packages.
        \item rootpy is still a work in progress.
        \item We have plans for many new features as well as addressing current issues
        \item Python 3 is becoming more mainstream -- support for this in rootpy
            will be required.
        \item Better integration with the IPython prompt: full tab completion
            and addition of helpful builtin commands like pylab.
        \item ROOT 6 will be coming out very soon. Cling will replace CINT.
            See this recent
            \href{http://indico.cern.ch/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=255&confId=149557}{talk at CHEP}.
            PyROOT and hence rootpy will hopefully benifit from these major
            ROOT developments. 
        \item Improve our online documentation and tutorials.
        \item Maybe someday an officially supported extension of ROOT?
    \end{itemize}
